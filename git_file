        Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

        Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
